## IMPROVEMENTS

To improve the tool:

+ Create a C++ library that extracts all icons from the ICO format (a parser).
+ Load routines are easily detectable once the code is known, hence a small script to add arbitrary redundant or “dead” code to the source and compile that version.
+ Adding more methods to hide information in different languages.
+ Adding more methods to obtain information from the icon in different languages.
+ Adding more routines to make use of the extracted information.
